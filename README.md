# public_libraries
This week, I dove into a dataset on Public Libraries to uncover trends in library usage, staff expenditures, and circulation across various counties.

🔍 What I explored:

Top 20 counties with the highest average library visits

Distribution of staff salary expenditures

Relationships between visits, staff pay, and circulation via pair plots and scatterplots

A Z-test to statistically compare library visits between Hartford and New Haven counties

A correlation heatmap to visualize how variables relate

📈 Key insights:

There's a strong positive correlation between staff expenditures and library visits, suggesting investment in staff might directly influence usage.

Some counties consistently outperform others in circulation and visits—potential benchmarks for library planning.

🔬 Tools used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy)

📁 Dataset: Publicly available library data

👉 Whether you're passionate about data science, public services, or just curious about how data can tell a story, this was a fascinating project!
